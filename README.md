# Just an idea...

This is just the start of a little microsite idea I wanna do in 2020. 

I cloned this intial project from Phil's [ElevenTail](https://eleventail.netlify.com/about/) to give me a starter kit.


## Prerequisites

- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-cli)


## Running locally

```bash

# install Netlify CLI globally
npm install netlify-cli -g

# install the project dependencies
npm install

# run the build and server locally
netlify dev
```
