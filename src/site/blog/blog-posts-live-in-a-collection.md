title: Blog posts live in a collection

Eleventy lets you gather items together into collections in a variety of ways. I regularly want to have a set of blog posts so ElevenTail is set up with a collection of posts held in a `blog` folder.

Posts are markdown files, but could be any other formats supported by Eleventy. And a custom plugin written in JavaScript gives access to the content of the post before and after an excerpt delimiter so that they can be styled differently like this.
