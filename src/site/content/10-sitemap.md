title: Build a sitemap
---

If your site is large/complex (over 500 pages), search engines like Google [suggest](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en) a sitemap so they can more intelligently crawl your site.

### Principals

- Produce site map files only for production
- Aren't there different kinds like video site maps?
- Is this a good time to look for broken links? Probably takes a while? Run on a CRON or async against master?

### Relevant Tools

- Something that makes site maps
- [broken-link-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/broken-link-checker)
