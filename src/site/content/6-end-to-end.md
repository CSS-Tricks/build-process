Make sure your website is doing all the important things it should be doing. End-to-end tests are great for testing whole usage flows like visiting a URL, clicking a button, and making sure a certain modal is open with the correct text in it. Or going through a sign up process.

### Principals

### Relevant Tools

- Cypress
