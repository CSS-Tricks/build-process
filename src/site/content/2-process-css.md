title: Process CSS
---

You likely need to process your CSS as you develop. This site will assume a Sass setup, but it could be all PostCSS, or Stylus and Autoprefixer, Tailwind and PurgeCSS and cssnano, etc.

The main point is to not commit the processed/minified files to the repo. They are useless there, creating noisy commits.
