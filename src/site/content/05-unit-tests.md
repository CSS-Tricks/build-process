title: Run Unit Tests
---

Make sure your JavaScript is doing what you wrote it to do, by writing unit tests and making sure those tests pass.

### Principals

- Run your unit tests on every commit
- Don't deploy Pull/Merge requests if the tests fail
- Notifications for failures

### Relevant Tools

- Testing frameworks: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Tape](https://jasmine.github.io/)
- Assertion libraries: [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
