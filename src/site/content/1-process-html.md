title: Process HTML
---

By processing HTML, I mean turning templates, layouts, partials, and data into flat (probably minified) HTML. You’ll need to do this processing in development to work on your site, but you don’t need to commit the processed HTML to your repo. The build process can produce it there with different options, like you could minifiy HTML in production but not in development.
